# Everybody Into The Pool! Node.js For .Net Developers

## Matthew Soucoup

## Synopsis
It seems like Node.js is showing up everywhere these days. It’s a hot topic at user groups, Microsoft supports it in Azure, heck, even people at your day job are talking about it! Why not get your toes wet and discover what all the talk is about? In this session you’re going to find out what exactly Node.js is and why a .NET developer would want to learn it. Then you’ll wade into the pool and learn how to install Node.js and use it within Visual Studio. After the obligatory Hello World, or “Look Mom, I Can Swim” app, you’ll hit the deep-end with using Node.js and Azure. Then finally go off the ledge with Edge.js and invoking CLR libraries from Node.js. So jump on into the pool, the water is warm!
