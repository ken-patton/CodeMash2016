# Cure What Ails You With This Rx - An Intro To The Reactive Extensions

## Matthew Soucoup

## Synopsis
Taps and touches and keyboard clicks arrive from the user in blazing fashion … tons of tweets need to be handled … a stream of stock prices coming in hot … and your app needs to handle all of these events right now … it’s enough to make you sick! Take a deep breath and take this Rx … of Reactive Extensions. Find out once and for all what exactly is meant by reactive programming and what the Reactive Extensions are. Find out how the Observable will soothe your ills and how Rx makes asynchronous programming much easier. You’ll leave this session with an understanding of how to observe and subscribe to changes, query those changes, and then how to synchronize all of this asynchrony back to the UI. All the while laying out the code in a very readable and declarative manner.
