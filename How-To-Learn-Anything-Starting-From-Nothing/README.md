## Friendly Note

Thank you for attending my talk.

You can use the slides along with youtube videos to teach yourself quickly how to solve the Rubik's Cube.

Rubik's Cube in this talk was used as a teaching device to understand the following concepts:

- System 1 and System 2 thinking based on research by Kahneman and Tversky.
- An act of "distinguishing", an act of making a concept real and alive for someone so they can perceive 'distinctly' something now which they were not able to perceive before. This is an act of semantic meaning making.
- Emotions, fears, doubts when learning something one does not understand.
- The 3 stages of motor learning research by Fitts and Posner.
- Mnemonics. Memory techniques

I believe the real learning starts with enaging in acts of "distinguishing", making meaning and organizing that meaning. Memory techniques, mnemonics, heuristics can be designed as cheap mental shortcuts to a deep understanding that is gainded from "distinguishing". Remembering brute force style or a memory trick style without distinguishing limits you from teaching others. This is a very large study of cognitive science and I look forward learning more how to learn things I don't understand.

Thanks.
